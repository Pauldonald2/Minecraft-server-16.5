# Minecraft-server-16.5
here you can create a simple minecraft server with this script

simply download the file: wget http://survivalmcnew.ddns.net/server.sh

and run it with sudo ./server.sh. Attention the file has to be started with sudo right otherwise it won't work. The file will download 2 programs and they will install java and the unzip then the script downloads the data from the official spigot / bukkit server and 2 files from my server.
Have fun
