# Minecraft-server-16.5
here you can create a simple minecraft server with this script
simply download the file and run it with sudo ./server.sh. Attention the file has to be started with sudo right otherwise it won't work. The file will download 2 programs and they will install java and the unzip program, among others.
Have fun
